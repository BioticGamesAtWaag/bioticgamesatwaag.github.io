Welcome to the wonderful world of *Biotic Games*!
Sign up for the Campus Party workshop at (http://campuse.ro/events/campus-party-europe-2016/workshop/Biotic-Games/)[http://campuse.ro/events/campus-party-europe-2016/workshop/Biotic-Games/]

### Euglena Spaceships
When science meets games, it makes everyoneÂ´s eyes sparkle! Computer games are great fun and we all have our favourite games we played when we were kids, or even continue to play as grown ups. But computer games have been more than just fun. Games have increased interest in computing, and playful tinkering projects have been a valuable source of innovation, and have changed the way we interact with technology.

Now enter the 21st century, enter the century of biotechnology. It is time to embrace the innovative power of gaming in the context of biological systems. Join our workshop and interact with Euglena. Create new hardware, games or level designs in our workshop. Let's have fun, all for the benefit of science and the progress of our understanding of microbial interaction in health and diseases.

Participants will use technology to interact with living organisms in a playful manner. They will turn the joystick and press the buttons to change the swimming direction of the protist protagonists, and track the position of the organisms digitally to interact with them as players in a computer game. During the workshop, they will build a biological gaming device and prototype a game. Connecting computing and engineering with biology, we hope a large public can be involved in biotechnology and make a positive contribution to formal and informal education.

This workshop is intended for (bio)scientists, designers, (game) developers, engineers, artists and media technologists. Please bring your computer and phone. Background knowledge in biological gaming is not required, but highly appreciated.
